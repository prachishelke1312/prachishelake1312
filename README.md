# 💫 About Me:
I am a Computer Engineering student pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.), with a strong interest in programming, problem-solving, and practical implementation of computer science concepts.<br><br>This GitHub repository contains my academic and project-based work, including Java programs, C programming codes, and important Data Structures questions that are closely related to my college curriculum. These programs focus on building a clear understanding of core concepts such as logic building, algorithms, and efficient data handling.<br><br>Along with academic programs, I have also uploaded project source codes, which reflect my hands-on experience in applying theoretical knowledge to real-world problems. I use GitHub to learn, practice, organize my work, and continuously improve my coding skills.<br><br>I am eager to explore new technologies, strengthen my fundamentals, and grow as a computer engineer through consistent learning and practical development.
